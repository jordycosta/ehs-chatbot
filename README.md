# ehs-chatbot
Users have reported difficulties navigating Cal Poly's Environmental Health and Wellness website. As such, we have designed a ChatBot to ease these difficulties.
Our bot should reduce the number of calls into the office by providing an intuitive and interactive ChatBot with whom users can relay their needs.
